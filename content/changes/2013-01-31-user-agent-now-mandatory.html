Following on from our [previous post](http://developer.github.com/changes/2012-10-14-rate-limit-changes/)
about requiring requests to include a valid [User Agent header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent)
we have now changed our configuration to block any API request which does not include a User Agent.

Setting this helps us identify requests from you, and get in touch with people who are using
the API in a way which causes disruption to GitHub. Most HTTP libraries and tools like cURL
already provide a valid header for you, and allow you to customize it, so this will not require
many of our users to make any changes whatsoever.

If you have any questions or feedback, please drop us a line at
[support@github.com](mailto:support@github.com?subject=User Agent Requirement).
