Improvements continue to the Organizations Repository listing endpoint.
Today we're improving pagination so that it works as documented.  Now you
can actually use `page` and `per_page` query params, or, better still, use
the `Link` headers to navigate through the results space.

The docs for Organization Repositories queries are still here:

* [Organization Repositories](/v3/repos/#list-organization-repositories)
