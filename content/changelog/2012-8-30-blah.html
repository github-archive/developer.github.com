title: Upcoming Changes to Watcher and Star APIs
---

We recently [changed the Watcher behavior][change-watching] on GitHub.  What
used to be known as "Watching", is now "Starring".  Starring is basically
a way to bookmark interesting repositories.  Watching is a way to indicate that
you want to receive email or web notifications on a Repository.

This works well on GitHub.com, but poses a problem for the GitHub API.  How do
we change this in a way that developers can gracefully upgrade their
applications?  We're currently looking at rolling out the changes in three
phases over an extended period of time.

## Current Status

The current [Repository Starring][starring-api] methods look like this:

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/watchers` - A list of users starring the repository.
* `/users/:user/watched` - A list of repositories that a user has starred.
* `/user/watched` - A list of repositories the current user has starred.

## Phase 1: Add Watchers as Subscriptions

In addition to this, we'll expose Watchers as "Subscriptions".  This is to
keep from clashing with the legacy endpoint.

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/subscribers` - A list of users watching the repository.
* `/user/subscriptions` - A list of repositories the current user is watching.

Note: we don't plan to expose what other users are watching.

We'll also add a copy of the legacy Watchers API in the new endpoint:

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/stargazers` - A list of users starring the repository.
* `/users/:user/starred` - A list of repositories that a user has starred.
* `/user/starred` - A list of repositories the current user has starred.

This will be done with the current mime type for the API:

    application/vnd.github.beta+json

If you care about your application not breaking, make sure all outgoing API
requests pass that value for the "Accept" header.

    # Accesses a user's starred repositories.
    curl https://api.github.com/user/watched \
      -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.beta+json"

## Phase 2: Switch `/watchers` API Endpoint

The "watch" endpoints will now be a copy of the "subscription" endpoints.  You
will have to use `/user/starred` to get a user's starred repositories, not
`/user/watched`.

This requires a new mime type value:

    application/vnd.github.v3+json

We will release this change in an experimental mode first, letting developers
gracefully upgrade their applications by specifying the new mime value for the
Accept header.

    # Accesses a user's watched repositories.
    curl https://api.github.com/user/watched \
      -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"

## Phase 3: Remove `/subscribers` API Endpoint.

This phase involves disabling the subscription endpoints completely.  At this
point, you should be using the starring endpoints for starred repositories, and
the watch endpoints for watched repositories.
